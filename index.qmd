::: {#hero-heading}

I am a Research Fellow and Data Scientist at the 
[University of Sheffield](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/smph/tony-stone) and
[University College London](https://profiles.ucl.ac.uk/92864-tony-stone).

My research is focused on maximising the utility of real world data through 
record linkage and by deriving robust evidence and actionable insights. 

I work across education, health and social care domains. I have extensive 
experience of unscheduled care and cancer services, especially in identifying 
measures to monitor performance and evaluate changes to services.

I previously supported work on the appraisal of alcohol policies through 
decision modelling, with a particular focus on specialist alcohol treatment 
services.
